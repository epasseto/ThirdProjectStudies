The power computations performed in the first part will _not_ work if the alternative proportion is greater than the null, e.g. detecting a proportion parameter of 0.88 against a null of 0.9. You might want to try to rewrite the code to handle that case! The same issue should not show up for the second approach, where we directly compute the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you need to do a two-tailed test, you should pay attention to two main things. First of all, the \"alpha\" parameter needs to account for the fact that the rejection region is divided into two areas. Secondly, you should perform the computation based on the worst-case scenario, the alternative case with the highest variability. Since, for the binomial, variance is highest when $p = .5$, decreasing as $p$ approaches 0 or 1, you should choose the alternative value that is closest to .5 as your reference when computing the necessary sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note as well that the above methods only perform sizing for _statistical significance_, and do not take into account _practical significance_. One thing that should be realized is that if the true size of the experimental effect is the same as the desired practical significance level, then it's a coin flip whether the mean will be above or below the practical significance bound. This also doesn't even consider how a confidence interval might interact with that bound. In a way, experiment sizing is a way of checking about whether or not you'll be able to get what you _want_ from running an experiment, rather than checking if you'll get what you _need_.\""

    "\"There are also tools and Python packages that can also help with sample sizing decisions, so you don't need to solve for every case on your own. The sample size calculator [here](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) is applicable for proportions, and provides the same results as the methods explored above. (Note that the calculator assumes a two-tailed test, however.) Python package \"statsmodels\" has a number of functions in its [`power` module](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/stats.html#power-and-sample-size-calculations) that perform power and sample size calculations. Unlike previously shown methods, differences between null and alternative are parameterized as an effect size (standardized difference between group means divided by the standard deviation). Thus, we can use these functions for more than just tests of proportions. If we want to do the same tests as before, the [`proportion_effectsize`](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_effectsize.html) function computes [Cohen's h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_h) as a measure of effect size. As a result, the output of the statsmodel functions will be different from the result expected above.

A short dummy test can be worth the investment if an invariant metric is found to have a statistically significant difference, or if some other systematic bias is identified, because it can help avoid larger problems down the line. A second reason to run a dummy test is to collect data on metrics' behaviors. If historic data is not enough to predict the outcome of recorded metrics or allow for experiment duration to be computed, then a dummy test can be useful for getting baselines.\n",

    "Of course, performing a dummy test requires an investment of resources, the most important of which is time.

In the A/B testing paradigm, this can take the form of an A/A/B test. That is, we split the data into three groups: two control and one experimental.

    "\"Up until now, you've been using standard hypothesis tests on means of normal distributions to design and analyze experiments. However, it's possible that you will encounter scenarios where you can't rely on only standard tests. This might be due to uncertainty about the true variability of a metric's distribution, a lack of data to assume normality, or wanting to do inference on a statistic that lacks a standard test. It's useful to know about some **non-parametric tests** not just as a workaround for cases like this, but also as a second check on your experimental results. The main benefit of a non-parametric test is that they don't rely on many assumptions of the underlying population, and so can be used in a wider range of circumstances compared to standard tests. In this notebook, you'll cover two non-parametric approaches that use resampling of the data to make inferences about distributions and differences.\""

    "\"Bootstrapping is used to estimate sampling distributions by using the actually collected data to generate new samples that could have been hypothetically collected. In a standard bootstrap, a bootstrapped sample means drawing points from the original data _with replacement_ until we get as many points as there were in the original data. Essentially, we're treating the original data as the population: without making assumptions about the original population distribution, using the original data as a model of the population is the best that we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a lot of bootstrapped samples allows us to estimate the sampling distribution for various statistics on our original data. For example, let's say that we wanted to create a 95% confidence interval for the 90th percentile from a dataset of 5000 data points. (Perhaps we're looking at website load times and want to reduce the worst cases.) Bootstrapping makes this easy to estimate. First of all, we take a bootstrap sample (i.e. draw 5000 points with replacement from the original data) and record the 90th percentile and repeat this a large number of times, let's say 100 000. From this bunch of bootstrapped 90th percentile estimates, we form our confidence interval by finding the values that capture the central 95% of the estimates (cutting off 2.5% on each tail). Implement this operation in the cells below, using the following steps:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  - Then, compute the `q`th quantile of the sample and add it to the `sample_qs` list. If you're using numpy v0.15 or later, you can use the [`quantile`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.quantile.html) function to get the quantile directly with `q`; on v0.14 or earlier, you'll need to put `q` in terms of a percentile and use [`percentile`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.percentile.html) instead.\n",

This is because there will be things that we don't know about the real world that we can't account for, due to not having a parametric model of the world's state. Consider the extreme case of trying to understand the distribution of the maximum value: our confidence interval would never be able to include any value greater than the largest observed value and it makes no sense to have any lower bound below the maximum observation. Intuitively, however, there's a pretty clear possibility for there to be unobserved values that are larger than the one we've observed, especially for skewed data like shown in the example.\n",

    "This doesn't override the bootstrap method's advantages, however. The bootstrap procedure is fairly simple and straightforward. Since you don't make assumptions about the distribution of data, it can be applicable for any case you encounter. The results should also be fairly comparable to standard tests. But it does take computational effort, and its output does depend on the data put in. For reference, for the 95% CI on the 90th percentile example explored above, the inferred interval would only capture about 83% of 90th percentiles from the original generating distribution. But a more intricate procedure using a binomial assumption to index on the observed data only does about one percentage point better (84%).

The simplest case we can consider is if we have _n_ independent evaluation metrics, and that seeing one with a statistically significant result would be enough to call the manipulation a success. In this case, the probability of making at least one Type I error is given by $\\alpha_{over} = 1 - (1-\\alpha_{ind})^n$ , illustrated in the below image for individual $\\alpha_{ind} = .05$ and $\\alpha_{ind} = .01:\n",

    "The Å idÃ¡k correction is only slightly higher than the line drawn by the Bonferroni correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, evaluation scenarios are rarely so straightforward. Metrics will likely be correlated in some way, rather than being independent. If a positive correlation exists, then knowing the outcome of one metric will make it more likely for a correlated metric to also point in the same way. In this case, the corrections above will be more conservative than necessary, resulting in an overall error rate smaller than the desired level. (In cases of negative correlation, the true error rate could go either way, depending on the types of tests performed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we might need multiple metrics to show statistical significance to call an experiment a success, or there may be different degrees of success depending on which metrics appear to be moved by the manipulation. One metric may not be enough to make it worth deploying a change tested in an experiment. Reducing the individual error rate will make it harder for a truly significant effect to show up as statistically significant. That is, reducing the Type I error rate will also increase the Type II error rate â another conservative shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is a small balancing act when it comes to selecting an error-controlling scheme. Being fully conservative with one of the simple corrections above means that you increase the risk of failing to roll out changes that actually have an impact on metrics. Consider the level of dependence between metrics and what results are needed to declare a success to calibrate the right balance in error rates. If you need to see a significant change in all of your metrics to proceed with it, you might not need a correction factor at all. You can also use dummy test results, bootstrapping, and permutation approaches to plan significance thresholds. Finally, don't forget that practical significance can be an all-important quality that overrides other statistical significance findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the main focus of this page has been on interpretation of evaluation metrics, it's worth noting that these cautions also apply to invariant metrics. The more invariant metrics you test, the more likely it will be that some test will show a statistically significant difference even if the groups tested are drawn from equivalent populations. However, it might not be a good idea to apply a correction factor to individual tests since we want to avoid larger issues with interpretation later on. As mentioned previously, a single invariant metric showing a statistically significant difference is not necessarily cause for alarm, but it is something that merits follow-up in case it does have an effect on our analysis.\"\n",

    "\"The simulation function below uses a bernoulli / binomial success model for the outcome metric, measuring against a historic baseline. That is, each observation is a single coin flip with success probability \"p\". If we see a number of successes that is unusual for our baseline value of \"p\", then we declare a statistically significant result. We will divide the experiment length into multiple 'blocks', checking the status of the experiment after each block is complete. Our outputs of interest are the proportion of trials that are statistically significant in _any_ test, and the proportion of trials that are statistically significant after _each_ individual block.\"\n",

    "There are three main steps to filling out the `peeking_sim()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate some data\n",
    " - Compute the number of trials per block. For simplicity, just round up any fractions so that each block has the same number of trials: we might end up with slightly more trials per block than the corresponding function parameter.\n",
    " - Generate a data matrix with the number of successes observed in each block: the number of rows should be the number of simulations and the number of columns the number of blocks. You can do this with a single call to numpy's [`random.binomial`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.binomial.html) function.\n",
    "2. Compute z-scores at each 'peek'\n",
    " - For each row, compute the cumulative number of successes after each 'block' of the experiment using numpy's [`cumsum`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html) function. The result should be a matrix with the same dimensions as the data, but each column cumulatively adds up the values in each row up to that point.\n",
    " - Compute the expected mean and standard deviation for the number of successes after each 'block' of the experiment. Remember that this will be based on the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) and is centered on the raw counts, rather than proportion of successes. It'll be useful to create a vector with the cumulative sum of trials after each block to facilitate these calculations.\n",
    " - Use the cumulative counts, the expected counts, and the standard deviations, to compute the z-scores for each peek at the experiment.\n",
    "3. Aggregate test outcomes\n",
    " - Compute a critical z-value using the supposed Type I error rate. Use this critical value to flag which of the z-scores would be counted as statistically significant, and which would not.\n",
    " - The proportion of trials that are significant at _any_ test will be the proportion of rows that have at least one flagged value. The proportion of trials that are significant at _each_ block will be the mean number of flagged values in each column; this will be a 1-d array. Return both of these values as the output of the function."

    "\"The safest way we could deal with performing multiple checks and making poor early stopping decisions is to simply not do it. Once an experiment has been planned and all assignment procedures checked, you should just let the experiment run to completion and just assess the results at the very end. That's not to say that you can't perform early stopping, but it does require additional planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way in which you could solve for multiple peeking is to adjust the significance level of individual tests so that the overall error rate is at its desired level. But applying the Bonferroni or Å idÃ¡k corrections as shown earlier in the lesson will definitely be too conservative, since we know that there is a correlation in test results between peeks. If we see some simulated run with z-score above the threshold at the halfway point, it's more likely to be above that threshold at the end point, compared to some other simulated run that is not statistically significant at the halfway point. One way in which we can obtain a better significance threshold is through the power of simulation. After performing the same steps 1 and 2 above, we want to find a significance level that would call our desired proportion of simulated tests as statistically significant:\n",

Note how this is somewhat higher than the .025 or .0253 that would have been generated from the Bonferroni and Å idÃ¡k corrections, respectively. Test with a higher number of simulations and trials to get more accurate estimates, and try out different numbers of blocks to see how it changes the individual error rate needed. The results should approximately match up with the numbers given in the table in the middle of [this article](https://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-run-an-ab-test.html); note that peeking $n$ times means splitting the experiment into $n + 1$ blocks.\""
