Do this many times (200 000 repetitions should provide a good speed-variability balance in this case) and then see in how many simulated cases we get as extreme or more extreme a deviation from 50/50 that we actually observed. Don't forget that, since we have a two-sided test, an extreme case also includes values on the opposite side of 50/50. (e.g. Since simulated outcomes of .48 and lower are considered as being more extreme than an actual observation of 0.48, so too will simulated outcomes of .52 and higher.) The proportion of flagged simulation outcomes gives us a p-value on which to assess our observed proportion. We hope to see a larger p-value, insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\""

    "\"The example explored above is a one-tailed test, with the alternative value greater than the null. The power computations performed in the first part will _not_ work if the alternative proportion is greater than the null, e.g. detecting a proportion parameter of 0.88 against a null of 0.9. You might want to try to rewrite the code to handle that case! The same issue should not show up for the second approach, where we directly compute the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find that you need to do a two-tailed test, you should pay attention to two main things. First of all, the \"alpha\" parameter needs to account for the fact that the rejection region is divided into two areas. Secondly, you should perform the computation based on the worst-case scenario, the alternative case with the highest variability. Since, for the binomial, variance is highest when $p = .5$, decreasing as $p$ approaches 0 or 1, you should choose the alternative value that is closest to .5 as your reference when computing the necessary sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note as well that the above methods only perform sizing for _statistical significance_, and do not take into account _practical significance_. One thing that should be realized is that if the true size of the experimental effect is the same as the desired practical significance level, then it's a coin flip whether the mean will be above or below the practical significance bound. This also doesn't even consider how a confidence interval might interact with that bound. In a way, experiment sizing is a way of checking about whether or not you'll be able to get what you _want_ from running an experiment, rather than checking if you'll get what you _need_.\""

    "\"There are also tools and Python packages that can also help with sample sizing decisions, so you don't need to solve for every case on your own. The sample size calculator [here](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html) is applicable for proportions, and provides the same results as the methods explored above. (Note that the calculator assumes a two-tailed test, however.) Python package \"statsmodels\" has a number of functions in its [`power` module](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/stats.html#power-and-sample-size-calculations) that perform power and sample size calculations. Unlike previously shown methods, differences between null and alternative are parameterized as an effect size (standardized difference between group means divided by the standard deviation). Thus, we can use these functions for more than just tests of proportions. If we want to do the same tests as before, the [`proportion_effectsize`](http://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_effectsize.html) function computes [Cohen's h](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_h) as a measure of effect size. As a result, the output of the statsmodel functions will be different from the result expected above. This shouldn't be a major concern since in most cases, you're not going to be stopping based on an exact number of observations. You'll just use the value to make general design decisions.\""

A short dummy test can be worth the investment if an invariant metric is found to have a statistically significant difference, or if some other systematic bias is identified, because it can help avoid larger problems down the line. A second reason to run a dummy test is to collect data on metrics' behaviors. If historic data is not enough to predict the outcome of recorded metrics or allow for experiment duration to be computed, then a dummy test can be useful for getting baselines.\n",

In the A/B testing paradigm, this can take the form of an A/A/B test. That is, we split the data into three groups: two control and one experimental.

It's useful to know about some **non-parametric tests** not just as a workaround for cases like this, but also as a second check on your experimental results. The main benefit of a non-parametric test is that they don't rely on many assumptions of the underlying population, and so can be used in a wider range of circumstances compared to standard tests.

In a standard bootstrap, a bootstrapped sample means drawing points from the original data _with replacement_ until we get as many points as there were in the original data. Essentially, we're treating the original data as the population: without making assumptions about the original population distribution, using the original data as a model of the population is the best that we can do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a lot of bootstrapped samples allows us to estimate the sampling distribution for various statistics on our original data. For example, let's say that we wanted to create a 95% confidence interval for the 90th percentile from a dataset of 5000 data points. (Perhaps we're looking at website load times and want to reduce the worst cases.) Bootstrapping makes this easy to estimate. First of all, we take a bootstrap sample (i.e. draw 5000 points with replacement from the original data) and record the 90th percentile and repeat this a large number of times, let's say 100 000. From this bunch of bootstrapped 90th percentile estimates, we form our confidence interval by finding the values that capture the central 95% of the estimates (cutting off 2.5% on each tail).

    "\"Confidence intervals coming from the bootstrap procedure will be optimistic compared to the true state of the world. This is because there will be things that we don't know about the real world that we can't account for, due to not having a parametric model of the world's state. Consider the extreme case of trying to understand the distribution of the maximum value: our confidence interval would never be able to include any value greater than the largest observed value and it makes no sense to have any lower bound below the maximum observation. Intuitively, however, there's a pretty clear possibility for there to be unobserved values that are larger than the one we've observed, especially for skewed data like shown in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't override the bootstrap method's advantages, however. The bootstrap procedure is fairly simple and straightforward. Since you don't make assumptions about the distribution of data, it can be applicable for any case you encounter. The results should also be fairly comparable to standard tests. But it does take computational effort, and its output does depend on the data put in. For reference, for the 95% CI on the 90th percentile example explored above, the inferred interval would only capture about 83% of 90th percentiles from the original generating distribution. But a more intricate procedure using a binomial assumption to index on the observed data only does about one percentage point better (84%). And both of these depend on the specific data generated: a different set of 5000 points will produce different intervals, with different accuracies.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\"The permutation test is a resampling-type test used to compare the values on an outcome variable between two or more groups. In the case of the permutation test, resampling is done on the group labels. The idea here is that, under the null hypothesis, the outcome distribution should be the same for all groups, whether control or experimental. Thus, we can emulate the null by taking all of the data values as a single large group. Applying labels randomly to the data points (while maintaining the original group membership ratios) gives us one simulated outcome from the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest follows similar to the sampling approach to a standard hypothesis test, except that we haven't specified a reference distribution to sample from – we're sampling directly from the data we've collected. After applying the labels randomly to all the data and recording the outcome statistic many times, we compare our actual, observed statistic against the simulated statistics. A p-value is obtained by seeing how many simulated statistic values are as or more extreme as the one actually observed, and a conclusion is then drawn.\"\n",

    "  - Then, compute the `q`th quantile of the data points that have been assigned to each group based on the permuted labels. Append the difference in quantiles to the `sample_diffs` list.\n",
    "- After gathering the quantile differences for permuted samples, compute the observed difference for the actual data. Then, compute a p-value from the number of permuted sample differences that are less than or greater than the observed difference, depending on the desired alternative hypothesis."

    "\"Up until now, you've been using standard hypothesis tests on means of normal distributions to design and analyze experiments. However, it's possible that you might encounter scenarios where you can't rely on only standard tests. This might be due to uncertainty about the true variability of a metric's distribution, a lack of data to assume normality, or wanting to do inference on a statistic that lacks a standard test. It's useful to know about some **non-parametric tests** not just as a workaround for cases like this, but also as a second check on your experimental results.\""

    "\n",
    "#### In Udacity notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The rank-sum test is fairly different from the two previous approaches. There's no resamplng involved; the test is performed only on the data present. The rank-sum test, also known as the Mann-Whitney U test, is not a test of any particular statistic, like the mean or median. Instead, it's a test of distributions: let's say we draw one value at random from the populations behind each group. The null hypothesis says that there's an equal chance that the larger value is from the first group as the second group; the alternative hypothesis says that there's an unequal chance, which can be specified as one- or two-tailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to test this hypothesis, we should look at the data we've collected and see in how many cases values from one group win compared to values in the second. That is, for each data point in the first group, we count how many values in the second group that are smaller than it. (If both values are equal, we count that as a tie, worth +0.5 to the tally.) This number of wins for the first group gives us a value $U$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that $U$ is approximately normally-distributed, given a large enough sample size. If we have $n_1$ data points in the first group and $n_2$ points in the second, then we have a total of $n_1 n_2$ matchups and an equivalent number of victory points to hand out. Under the null hypothesis, we should expect the number of wins to be evenly distributed between groups, and so the expected wins are $\\mu_U = \\frac{n_1 n_2}{2}$. The variability in the number of wins can be found to be the following equation (assuming no or few ties):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\sigma_U = \\sqrt{\\frac{n_1n_2(n_1+n_2+1)}{12}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These $\\mu_U$ and $\\sigma_U$ values can then be used to compute a standard normal z-score, which generates a p-value. Implement this method of performing the rank-sum test in the cells below!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- HINT: scipy stats' [`norm`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.html) class can be used to obtain p-values after computing a z-score."

    "Also, there already exists a function in the scipy stats package [`mannwhitneyu`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.html) that performs the Mann Whitney U test. This function considers more factors than the implementation above, including a correction on the standard deviation for ties and a continuity correction (since we're approximating a discretely-valued distribution with a continuous one). In addition, the approach they take is computationally more efficient, based on the sum of value ranks (hence the rank-sum test name) rather than the matchups explanation provided above.\"\n",

    "\"The sign test also only uses the collected data to compute a test result. It only requires that there be paired values between two groups to compare, and tests whether one group's values tend to be higher than the other's.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sign test, we don't care how large differences are between groups, only which group takes a larger value. So a comparison of 0.21 vs. 0.22 and 0.21 vs. 0.31 are both counted equally as a point in favor of the second group. This makes the sign test a fairly weak test, though also a test that can be applied fairly broadly. It's most useful when we have very few observations to draw from and can't make a good assumption of underlying distribution characteristics. For example, you might use a sign test as an additional check on click rates that have been aggregated on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The count of victories for a particular group can be modeled with the binomial distribution. Under the null hypothesis, it is equally likely that either group has a larger value (in the case of a tie, we ignore the comparison): the binomial distribution's success parameter is $p = 0.5$. Implement the sign test in the function below!\"\n",

    "\"If you're tracking multiple evaluation metrics, make sure that you're aware of how the Type I error rates on individual metrics can affect the overall chance of making some kind of Type I error. The simplest case we can consider is if we have _n_ independent evaluation metrics, and that seeing one with a statistically significant result would be enough to call the manipulation a success. In this case, the probability of making at least one Type I error is given by $\\alpha_{over} = 1 - (1-\\alpha_{ind})^n$ , illustrated in the below image for individual $\\alpha_{ind} = .05$ and $\\alpha_{ind} = .01:\n",
    " \n",
    "![multimetrics](graphs/multimetrics1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To protect against this, we need to introduce a correction factor on the individual test error rate so that the overall error rate is at most the desired level. A conservative approach is to divide the overall error rate by the number of metrics tested:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_{ind} = \\alpha_{over}/n$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as the Bonferroni correction. If we assume independence between metrics, we can do a little bit better with the Šidák correction:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha_{ind} = 1-(1-\\alpha_{over})^{1/n}\n",
    "\n",
    "![multimetrics](graphs/multimetrics2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Šidák correction is only slightly higher than the line drawn by the Bonferroni correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, evaluation scenarios are rarely so straightforward. Metrics will likely be correlated in some way, rather than being independent. If a positive correlation exists, then knowing the outcome of one metric will make it more likely for a correlated metric to also point in the same way. In this case, the corrections above will be more conservative than necessary, resulting in an overall error rate smaller than the desired level. (In cases of negative correlation, the true error rate could go either way, depending on the types of tests performed.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we might need multiple metrics to show statistical significance to call an experiment a success, or there may be different degrees of success depending on which metrics appear to be moved by the manipulation. One metric may not be enough to make it worth deploying a change tested in an experiment. Reducing the individual error rate will make it harder for a truly significant effect to show up as statistically significant. That is, reducing the Type I error rate will also increase the Type II error rate – another conservative shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there is a small balancing act when it comes to selecting an error-controlling scheme. Being fully conservative with one of the simple corrections above means that you increase the risk of failing to roll out changes that actually have an impact on metrics. Consider the level of dependence between metrics and what results are needed to declare a success to calibrate the right balance in error rates. If you need to see a significant change in all of your metrics to proceed with it, you might not need a correction factor at all. You can also use dummy test results, bootstrapping, and permutation approaches to plan significance thresholds. Finally, don't forget that practical significance can be an all-important quality that overrides other statistical significance findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the main focus of this page has been on interpretation of evaluation metrics, it's worth noting that these cautions also apply to invariant metrics. The more invariant metrics you test, the more likely it will be that some test will show a statistically significant difference even if the groups tested are drawn from equivalent populations. However, it might not be a good idea to apply a correction factor to individual tests since we want to avoid larger issues with interpretation later on. As mentioned previously, a single invariant metric showing a statistically significant difference is not necessarily cause for alarm, but it is something that merits follow-up in case it does have an effect on our analysis.\"\n",

    "There are three main steps to filling out the `peeking_sim()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simulate some data\n",
    " - Compute the number of trials per block. For simplicity, just round up any fractions so that each block has the same number of trials: we might end up with slightly more trials per block than the corresponding function parameter.\n",
    " - Generate a data matrix with the number of successes observed in each block: the number of rows should be the number of simulations and the number of columns the number of blocks. You can do this with a single call to numpy's [`random.binomial`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.binomial.html) function.\n",
    "2. Compute z-scores at each 'peek'\n",
    " - For each row, compute the cumulative number of successes after each 'block' of the experiment using numpy's [`cumsum`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.cumsum.html) function. The result should be a matrix with the same dimensions as the data, but each column cumulatively adds up the values in each row up to that point.\n",
    " - Compute the expected mean and standard deviation for the number of successes after each 'block' of the experiment. Remember that this will be based on the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) and is centered on the raw counts, rather than proportion of successes. It'll be useful to create a vector with the cumulative sum of trials after each block to facilitate these calculations.\n",
    " - Use the cumulative counts, the expected counts, and the standard deviations, to compute the z-scores for each peek at the experiment.\n",
    "3. Aggregate test outcomes\n",
    " - Compute a critical z-value using the supposed Type I error rate. Use this critical value to flag which of the z-scores would be counted as statistically significant, and which would not.\n",
    " - The proportion of trials that are significant at _any_ test will be the proportion of rows that have at least one flagged value. The proportion of trials that are significant at _each_ block will be the mean number of flagged values in each column; this will be a 1-d array. Return both of these values as the output of the function."

If we see some simulated run with z-score above the threshold at the halfway point, it's more likely to be above that threshold at the end point, compared to some other simulated run that is not statistically significant at the halfway point. One way in which we can obtain a better significance threshold is through the power of simulation.
